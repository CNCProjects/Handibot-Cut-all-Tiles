Handibot-Cut-all-Tiles
======================

This is a ShopBot file that will allow your Handibot to cut one tile after another without having to load each file one by one.

Here's how it works:

Written Instructions:

Go to VCarve and make a tiled toolpath. Save that toolpath with no filename. VCarve will create filenames with T1_.sbp T2_.sbp etc.

Drop this file from Github into the directory where you exported all of your tiles

Open Shopbot, set your parts folder to the folder you set in Step 2

Run the "Cut all tiles file"

It will open up and zero the axis by running that Zero XY SBP file

Then it will ask you to Zero your Z

And then it will ask you which tile you'd like to start with.

After each tile is done, move the machine over and hit the green button!
